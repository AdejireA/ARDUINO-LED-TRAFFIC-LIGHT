# Arduino Traffic Light Simulation

## Description
This Arduino sketch simulates traffic lights using three LEDs: red, yellow, and green. The traffic light operates in a sequence of red for stop, yellow for ready, and green for go.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino board (Arduino Uno)
- 3 LEDs (red, yellow, and green)
- Resistors
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
A schematic diagram showing how the components are connected is included.

[Insert your circuit diagram here]

## Installation
1. Connect the components according to the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch (`traffic_light.ino`) to your Arduino board.

## Usage
Once the sketch is uploaded, the traffic light simulation will start automatically. The LEDs will cycle through the sequence of red, yellow, and green lights, simulating a traffic light.

## Customization
- Adjust the timing of each light (red, yellow, green) to suit your needs.
- Modify the Arduino sketch to add additional features or change the behavior of the traffic light.
